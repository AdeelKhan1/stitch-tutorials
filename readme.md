# Stitch Tutorial Apps

The apps in this repo correspond to the tutorials in the 
[Stitch documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch). It is our aim to keep 
these tutorials always up to date with changes to Stitch, as well as changes to 
third-party products that are used in the apps. 

## Tutorials

The following tutorials are included:

- **/blog**: A basic javascript blog that demonstrates how to use Atlas and Stitch read & write rules. See the 
  [Basic Blog](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/build-blog/) tutorial
  for instructions.

### Todo Apps

The Todo apps let users create and maintain their own "todo" lists. These apps and the associated tutorials 
demonstrate how to use authentication providers, Stitch read and write rules, Functions, and third party service
integration. The following tutorials are available:


- **/todo-web**: A node-JS based todo application. 
See the [Building a Web-based To-Do App](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/todo-web/) 
tutorial for instructions.

- **/todo-android**: A Java application for Android that uses anonymous authentication and Mobile Sync. 
See the [To-Do (Android App)](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/todo-android/) 
tutorial for instructions.

- **/todo-android-advanced**: A Java application for Android that uses Mobile Sync and the Email/Password, 
Google, and Facebook OAuth authentication providers.
See the [To-Do Advanced (Android App)](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/todo-android/) 
tutorial for instructions.

- **/todo-ios**: A Swift application for iOS that uses anonymous authentication and Mobile Sync. 
See the [To-Do (iOS App)](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/todo-ios/) 
tutorial for instructions.


## Where are the other Tutorials?

There are several other sample apps available [here](https://github.com/mongodb/stitch-examples),
including the ones we used to have tutorials for. While we aim to keep them relatively fresh, they will 
take a lower priority to the tutorials above. We encourage the community to help maintain these apps 
by filing issues and PRs.
